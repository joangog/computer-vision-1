    "## General guidelines\n",
    "Your code and discussion must be submitted through this jupyter notebook, renamed to **13486578_12167320_14334739.ipynb** before the deadline by submitting it to the Canvas Lab 1 Assignment. For full credit, make sure your answer follows these guidelines:\n",
    "- Please express your thoughts concisely. The number of words does not necessarily correlate with how well you understand the concepts.\n",
    "- Answer all given questions.\n",
    "- Try to understand the problem as much as you can. When answering a question, give evidences (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, figures etc.) to support your arguments. Note that not everything might be explicitly asked for and you are expected to think about what might strengthen you arguments and make your notebook self-contained and complete.\n",
    "- Analyze your results and discuss them, e.g. why algorithm A works better than algorithm B in a certain problem.\n",
    "- Tables and figures must be accompanied by a brief description. Do not forget to add a number, a title, and if applicable name and unit of variables in a table, name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Late submissions are not allowed. Assignments that are submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs’ system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance, to avoid last minute system failure issues.\n",
    "Plagiarism note: Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious crime and any misconduct shall be punished with the university regulations."

    "Let us start with the grayscale sphere model, which is located in the SphereGray5 folder. The folder contains 5 images of a sphere with grayscale checker texture under similar lighting conditions with the one in the book. Your task is to estimate the surface reflectance (albedo) and surface normal of this model. The light source directions are encoded in the image file names.\n",

    "1. Complete the code for function **estimate_alb_nrm()** to estimate albedo and surface normal map for the SphereGray5 folder. What do you expect to see in albedo image and how is it different with your result?\n",
    "2. In principle, what is the minimum number of images you need to estimate albedo and surface normal? Run the algorithm with more images by using SphereGray25 and observe the differences in the results. You could try all images at once or a few at the time, in an incremental fashion. Choose a strategy and justify it by discussing your results.\n",
    "3. What is the impact of shadows in photometric stereo? Explain the trick that is used in the text to deal with shadows. Remove that trick and check your results. Is the trick necessary in the case of 5 images, how about 25 images?\n",

Compared to the monkey, the sphere's shape has less \"hidden faces\" and this is the reason there are fewer errors.

We use additive colors because the contrast they create with black screens works very well to produce digital images [1]. RGB is also convenient because it mimics the trichromatic nature of the human eye, which has different types of receptors called cones to sense red, green and blue [Lecture 2]. To capture a colored image, a standard digital camera is equipped with sensors that translate the wavelength of the photons to an RGB value.

The task of the automatic white balance (AWB) is to do the same in digital cameras so that the images taken by a digital camera look as natural as possible.\n",
