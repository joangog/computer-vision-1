    "## General Guidelines\n",
    "Your code and discussion must be completed in this **jupyter notebook** before the deadline by submitting it to the Canvas Lab 3 Assignment. Submit your assignment in a **zip file**, with all the relevant files and images need to run your notebook. Name your zip file as follows:  **StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.zip**\n",
    "For full credit, make sure your answers follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you use the provided python environment. You can create the environment using conda and the provided YAML file using the following command: `conda env create --file=CV1_env.yaml`, then activate it as `conda activate cv1`. Using different packages versions may result in the impossibility to run the submitted code and therefore in the subtraction of points. Below you will find a code cell to check the versions of your packages. \n",
    "- Please express your thoughts concisely. The number of words does not necessarily correlate with how well you understand the concepts.\n",
    "- Answer all given questions (in **<font color=green >Question** parts). Briefly describe what you implemented. **<font color=blue >Hint** parts are there to give you hints to answer questions.\n",
    "- Try to understand the problem as much as you can. When answering a question, give evidence (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, etc.) to support your arguments. Note that not everything might be explicitly asked for and you are expected to think about what might strengthen you arguments and make your notebook self-contained and complete.\n",
    "- Analyze your results and discuss them, e.g. why algorithm A works better than algorithm B in a certain problem.\n",
    "- Tables and figures must be accompanied by a brief description. Do not forget to add a number, a title, and if applicable name and unit of variables in a table, name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.\n",
    "- Make sure all the code in your notebook runs without errors or bugs before submitting. Code that does not run can result in a lower grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions** are not allowed. Assignments that are submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs’ system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance, to avoid last minute system failure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plagiarism note:** Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious crime and any misconduct shall be punished with the university regulations."

To select the windows, the eigenvalues of Z are calculated, and if both eigenvalues have big values, big enough to be over the user-defined threshold, then the window is selected as a feature. Two big eigenvalues represent patterns with a lot of texture information such as corners, salt-and-pepper textures and other patterns that can be tracked reliably.\n",

    "Optical flow is the apparent motion of image pixels or regions from one frame to the next, which results from moving objects in the image or from camera motion. Underlying optical flow is typically an assumption of $\\textit{brightness constancy}$. That is the image values (brightness, color, etc) remain constant over time, though their 2D position in the image may change. Algorithms for estimating optical flow exploit this assumption in various ways to compute a velocity field that describes the horizontal and vertical motion of every pixel in the image. For a 2D+t dimensional case a voxel at location $(x, y, t)$ with intensity $I(x, y, t)$ will have moved by $\\delta_x$, $\\delta_y$ and $\\delta_t$ between the two image frames, and the following image constraint equation can be given:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "I(x,y,t) = I(x+\\delta_x, y+\\delta_y, t+\\delta_t). \\tag{15}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the movement to be small, the image constraint at I(x, y, t) can be extended using Taylor series, truncated to first-order terms:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{16}\n",
    "I(x+\\delta_x, y+\\delta_y, t+\\delta_t) = I(x,y,t)+\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\delta_x +\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial y}\\delta_y+\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t}\\delta_t\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "where $V_x$ and $V_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity or optical flow of $I(x,y,t)$. Further, $I_x$, $I_y$ and $I_t$ are the derivatives of the image at $(x, y, t)$ in the corresponding directions, which defines the main equation of optical flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical flow is difficult to compute for two main reasons. First, in image regions that are roughly homogeneous, the optical flow is ambiguous, because the brightness constancy assumption is satisfied by many different motions. Second, in real scenes, the assumption is violated at motion boundaries and by miscellaneous lighting, non-rigid motions, shadows, transparency, reflections, etc. To address the former, all optical flow methods make some sort of assumption about the spatial variation of the optical flow that is used to resolve the ambiguity. Those are just assumptions about the world which are approximate and consequently may lead to errors in the flow estimates. The latter problem can be addressed by making much richer but more complicated assumptions about the changing image brightness or, more commonly, using robust statistical methods which can deal with 'violations' of the brightness constancy assumption."
